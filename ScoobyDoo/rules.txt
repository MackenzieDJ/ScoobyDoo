WHOLE AIM TO SURVIVE 100 ROUNDS
You start with just a dog.
Roll a dice (4) to see how many of the extra members that you get.
The first person you get is Velma, You may NOT choose the others!
Roll 2x(6) dice: 1/Zombie 2/Ammo 3/Zombie 4/Food 5/Nothing 6/Survivor
If you still have a dog you can reroll one of the dice.
However if you get a zombie the dog dies
